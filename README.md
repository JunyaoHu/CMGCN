# CMGCN
[ACL 2022] The source code of Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection via Cross-Modal Graph Convolutional Network

ATTENTION! 【this is an unofficial repo！】

## TODO
- [x] caffe environment building (use python3 to makefile)
- [x] total structure (imitate)
- [x] dataset pre-process (including box generating and vit feature generating)
- [ ] training and test (should adjust the dim as 768, i have something wrong with it, it should use a pre-trained model?)
